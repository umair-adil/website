      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Why I created my own writing system</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up with Urdu as my first language, I had always known that Urdu and Hindi are functionally similar (mutually intelligible) languages. We could watch Bollywood movies without any dubbing, Pakistani and Indian cricket players had regular banter on the field, and so on. (In fact, some even consider the two to be one language). At the same time, it was clear that Urdu and Hindi had some notable differences. The biggest and most obvious difference was the writing system.       
      </p>
      <p>
        Hindi and Urdu are written in completely different scripts. Hindi is written in the “Devanagari” script, which is descended from the Brahmi scripts of Sanskrit. Urdu, by contrast, is written in the “<a href="https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90" target="_blank">Nastaliq</a>" script, which is a calligraphic version of a script adapted from Persian, which in turn is descended from the Arabic script. As such, while Hindi and Urdu speakers can communicate with virtually no language barrier, in writing the two cannot understand each other at all.

      <h2>Learning Devanagari</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2024, I thought it would be a fun challenge to try and learn the Devanagari script of Hindi. My reasoning was that I already understood the spoken language; by learning to read and write it, I would be getting two languages for the price of one. This challenge turned out to be even easier than I anticipated. Before I knew it, I could read Hindi at an elementary school level, allowing me access to an entire corpus of literature that I previously did not have access to. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few reasons Devanagari was so easy for me to learn. Devanagari is much better suited for the Urdu-Hindi language than the Nastaliq script, with there being a much more direct sound-to-letter relationship. Also, they actually write their vowels rather than making the reader guess them from context (vowels are written as separate markers around consonants. Urdu does have vowel markers but they are optional and rarely used). To highlight what I am talking about, let me give a few examples of issues in Urdu writing that can create trouble and ambiguity for readers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">"و" : This single letter is used for the “v” sound (as in “vet”/"واپس "), the “o” sound (as in “so”/"کو "), and the “oo” sound (as in “soon”/"سورج"). As a result, the reader usually has to guess which sound is being represented by the letter based on context, which makes for very confusing reading if you run into a word you have not seen before (and don't know how to pronounce it in order to ask someone else). By contrast, in Devanagari, the “v” sound has its own letter "व", while “o” and “oo” get their own separate vowel markings. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">“S”: When you want to write the “s” sound, do you write "س", "ث", or "ص"? In the original Arabic all of these have different sounds, but in Urdu we usually pronounce all three of these the same. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">“ واپس”: is this pronounced “waapas” or “waapis”? Since the short vowels are not written, you can only tell the difference if you already know the answer. As I understand it, leaving out the vowels makes a lot of sense in Arabic, because in Arabic three consonants form the root of a noun, and the vowels are determined by the part of speech etc. Urdu, however, does not have this feature, and being able to read the vowel is important. (Note: I do not speak Arabic and have not studied old Arabic grammar. Please feel free to correct me on this by email).</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The fact that a letter's shape changes based on the other letters next to it. A lot has been said about this, so I'll keep it short: it makes it hard to learn Urdu.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Learning Devanagari was therefore very easy for me, and I can recommend it to any Urdu reader who has some free time. I can only imagine that a Hindi reader trying to do the reverse by learning Nastaliq would find it to be very difficult.
      </p>

      <h2>Some oddities</h2>
      <p>
        While I found Devanagari to be a systematic and consistent writing system, some oddities stuck out to me when I tried to learn it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The “default consonant”. I said earlier that in Hindi they write all their vowels with vowel markings. When a vowel marking is not placed, the reader is meant to assume that the vowel is pronounced with the “schwa” vowel (the simplest “uh” vowel, as in “sun”, “bird”, “none”, etc). For example, "व" refers to “va”, not just “v”. While this may seem to make the script more space-efficient, it opens the door to ambiguity. How do Hindi writers write consonant clusters (situations where a consonant is directly followed by another consonant without a vowel in between)? Sometimes they add a diagonal line below the letter to indicate that it is an “aadhi akshar” (half letter) and does not have a vowel. Other times they indicate the same by cutting off the right part of the letter (which is often the vertical stem that connects the letter to the top line). However, in some cases they just leave the letter as it is, and let the reader work out that if they see too many consonants together, they should start dropping vowels. I found this to be a point of ambiguity in the script.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">R or D? I had been confused for years prior why Hindi speakers transliterate the “retroflex flap” sound ڑ/ड़ differently from us. (“Transliteration” refers to writing a language in a different script, like writing Urdu using the English alphabet. It's quite common for Urdu and Hindi speakers to use the English alphabet online due to having QWERTY keyboards.) This sound does not exist in English, and so people writing Urdu/Hindi in the English script have to substitute it with a different letter. The thing I found strange was how consistently we transliterate it differently. For example, when writing the Urdu word for “mountain” I would always write “pahaar”, but a Hindi writer would be more inclined to write “pahaad” even though they pronounce the word the same way. After learning Devanagari I figured out why this consistent difference persists, and this led me to a further idea, but more on that later.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The aspirated problem: The very first thought I had when I started learning Devanagari/Hindi was “this language has twice as many letters as it needs”. What I mean by this is that when the Hindi letters are written down in order, they are written similar to this manner: “K, Kh, G, Gh, T, Th, D, Dh...” etc. The difference between these pairs is that Kh is the “aspirated” version of K, meaning the consonant ends with a release of air. I found it odd that they needed separate letters for this, though. In Urdu, we mark aspirated consonants by adding the letter ھ after them. For example, D/ड would be ڈ, while Dh/ढ would be ڈھ. (This is different from the letter H in Urdu, which is ح or ه). The idea of simply having a separate symbol to mark aspirated consonants therefore came naturally to me, which would cut the number of letters to be learned in half.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I wanted from my own script</h2>
      <p>
        Having looked at these oddities, I decided to see if I could create my own writing system for Urdu/Hindi from scratch. (Note: I do not mean to imply that I am smarter than the people who developed either of these scripts or that I can do a better job. I simply wanted to see what a script that fixes my problems would look like). I decided that any script I create should have the following properties:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Complete one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. This means that every sound should have one and only one letter representing it, and every letter should represent one and only one sound. This would completely remove all ambiguity in terms of pronunciation of written words.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">No redundancy. As I mentioned, the Hindi alphabet felt quite redundant when I was first learning it because of the separate letters for aspirated consonants. I wanted any such redundancies to be “factored out” in my script (in a systematic way, that is).</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Every regular sound in Urdu/Hindi should be included, and I also wanted the script to be usable for English (though I wasn't going to add every possible sound in English due to variations in dialect and accent).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It was at this point that I had an idea for a fourth property the script should have: the shape of a letter should tell us something about that letter. This would mean that, hypothetically, you could look at the shape of a letter you had not seen before, and make a guess as to how it is pronounced based on its similarity to different letters. To explain what I mean by that, I first need to explain how consonants work.
      </p>

      <h2>How consonants work</h2>
      <p>
        Linguists have something called a “consonant chart” that organizes a kind of “periodic table” of consonants. A consonant, to a linguist, can be described by three main properties: “place of articulation”, “manner of articulation”, and “voicing”. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The “place of articulation” refers to what part of the mouth or vocal tract you use to make the sound. For example, P, a “bilabial” consonant, is pronounced right at your lips, while K, a “velar” consonant, is pronounced further back in the mouth. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The “manner of articulation” refers to what exactly you do at your place of articulation. For example, P is a “plosive” consonant since it involves a sudden release of air/sound at the lips. F, by contrast, is a “fricative” consonant, since it involves more of a stream of air at the lips and teeth. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">“Voicing” refers to whether or not your vocal cords vibrate while making the sound. G is the voiced version of K, D is the voiced version of T, B is the voiced version of P, and so on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, most consonant sounds can be described using these properties. For example, P is a “voiceless bilabial plosive”. Note that there is much more detail and nuance to this than I have described, and there exist consonants in some languages that do not fit this pattern, but we don't need to get into the weeds of all that here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the consonant chart created by the IPA. Notice that some combinations of place and manner of articulation are impossible for humans to actually pronounce, hence the empty areas.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h2>Resolving the earlier confusion</h2>
      <p>
        Given this chart, I can get back to a point I made earlier. I had noticed that “ɽ”, the retroflex flap sound, when being written in the English script, is transliterated differently in Urdu than in Hindi. Specifically, it is transliterated as “r” by us Urdu speakers, while Hindi speakers tend to use the letter “d” instead. Consulting the above chart shows us that both of these options make sense: the retroflex flap is in the same row as the alveolar flap (the “ɾ” which we usually write as “r”), while being in the same column as the retroflex plosive (the “ɖ” which we usually write as “d”). In other words, Urdu speakers transliterate this consonant based on the manner of articulation, while Hindi speakers use the place of articulation. Both are correct in their own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this still does not explain why the split is so consistent between Urdu and Hindi speakers on how to write the retroflex flap in English. For instance, why don't we Urdu speakers write it as “d”, and why don't Hindi speakers write it as “r”? The answer, I believe, comes from how the letters are shaped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the Hindi letter for the retroflex flap:  "ड़”. Notice that it is almost identical to the Hindi letter for the retroflex plosive (D):  "ड". My guess is that psychologically, having used a script all your life, you would internalize the similarities and differences between letters that the script teaches you. Hindi readers, through immersion, subconsciously associate ड़ with ड, so they transliterate the retroflex flap into English as “D”.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about Urdu speakers, then? In Urdu, the retroflex flap letter ڑ resembles both R and D in shape. Notice that this letter has the shape of a "ط" on top of it. This marks it as a retroflex (all the retroflex consonants in Urdu have this shape on top: ڑ, ڈ, ٹ). The rest of the shape of the letter, meanwhile, is identical to ر, which is the “alveolar flap” (R). It would seem, then, that Urdu speakers should go both ways (R or D) with this letter. However, Urdu’s alphabetical order places ڑ right next to ر, while ڈ is relegated to a whole different row. Urdu readers, therefore, subconsciously associate this consonant with the letter R and transliterate it accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>Designing my own script</h2>
      <p>
        Notice how these scripts are already using the shape of their letters to tell us something about how similar the letters are to each other. It was this revelation that gave me the idea for the fourth property I mentioned earlier: this relationship could be made bidirectional and complete for all letters. In other words, any letter in one column of the IPA chart should look similar to all other letters in that column. Similarly, any letter in one row should look similar to all other letters in the same row.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is one more visual representation that could be made. Notice that the columns in the IPA chart are ordered from left to right by where in the mouth a sound is pronounced. The first one, “bilabial”, refers to the very front of the mouth, the two lips. It progresses down the vocal tract from there to the “glottal” on the right, which is all the way down by the vocal folds. This gives us a fifth property to adhere to: the variation in letter shapes from left to right should have some form of continuity to it (for example, how far a line in the letter is rotated tells us how far down the vocal tract the sound is produced). This encoded continuity would make it even more intuitive for a learned reader to associate the relationships between different consonants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on all these specifications that I set for myself, I set about designing my script. I decided to have some similarity with the Devanagari script (because that’s where this all started for me), so I decided to put a central horizontal line running along the middle of the script, with consonants on bottom and vowels on top. The script is written left-to-right, and if a vowel is directly above a consonant, the consonant is read first. 
      </p>

      <h2>Letter shapes and details</h2>
      <p>
        (Skip this part if you have a life)
      </p>
      <p>
        To design the shapes for the consonants, I needed a baseline shape they would all build off of. After trying and discarding a few options, I landed on a simple stencil: a vertical line would drop down from the horizontal line, and additions to that line would indicate the consonant. For example, a plosive consonant would have a single line directly connected to the horizontal, whereas a nasal would be connected to the horizontal with a circle. The second added line would be rotated according to the place of articulation, starting with a closed triangle on the right for the bilabial, and moving left for each change in place of articulation, until it reaches a closed triangle on the left for an uvular consonant. (If that's hard to follow, don't worry. Just look at the writing sample given to see the various letters).
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding to this system, I needed to have a systematic way to indicate whether or not a consonant is voiced, and whether or not it is aspirated. Keeping the script simple, I simply added a circle to the tip of the consonant to indicate it is voiced, and a dot below to indicate that it is aspirated. No circle means unvoiced, and no dot means not aspirated.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the vowels, recall my decision not to have an implied default vowel in the script. To represent the “schwa” vowel, therefore, I used the simplest shape, a single vertical line going up from the horizontal (the absence of it would imply there is no vowel). I identified twelve vowels that are present in Urdu-Hindi, and divided them into five basic short vowels, five corresponding long vowels (some of them might not be long vowels in different accents), and two “combination” vowels (not to be confused with diphthongs, this is merely a property of how similar the vowels sound to each other). Then it was easy to make five basic shapes for the short vowels, and augment these shapes with horizontal or vertical lines for the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        For vowels I also needed a way to nasalize them. In Urdu, we turn a vowel into a nasal vowel by adding a “noon ghunna”ں  after it. In Hindi, it is represented by either a dot, or a moon-shaped mark with a dot, being placed directly above the vowel. Keeping with my theme of simplicity, I simply represented nasalized vowels with a dot above the vowel.
      </p>

      <h2>The result</h2>
      <p>
        This completed version 1.0 of my script. I wrote an English paragraph in the script and sent it to some friends (without the translation). The responses were pretty fun. My friends variously called my script hieroglyphic or ancient Greek (it does resemble archaic scripts in some hard-to-describe way). One of my friends (who is a medical student and does not have any training in linguistics) actually managed to decode the script and read the paragraph back to me! Perhaps even more exciting was when I sent the same paragraph to a linguistics professor at my university. She complimented my script as being beautiful and very kindly allowed me the audit her course on writing systems for various modern and ancient languages. It was a very fun course, and I could talk at length about the fascinating things I learned there, but that would be an article all on its own.

      </div>
      <p>
        What began as an experiment in learning Devanagari turned into a study in how writing systems shape our thought and perception. Creating a new script started as a technical challenge to remove ambiguity and redundancy, but it also deepened my understanding of why different scripts evolve the way they do. Seeing Urdu and Hindi sounds represented through a system of my own design made me appreciate both traditions better.
      </p>

      <h2>The challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Rather than sharing the alphabet with the readers, I will set this script as a challenge. You already know quite a bit about the script, you have an English writing sample in the script, and you know for a fact that the script can be cracked. If you decipher the script, reach out to me with the translation. I don't have any rewards to give out other than bragging rights, but I imagine it might be a fun challenge.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        I must apologize to linguists for being so fast-and-loose with proper terminology. Writing for a general audience, I didn’t want to overwhelm them with terms like “grapheme”, “phoneme”, “abugida” and so on. The article has enough technical jargon as it is. General readers should be aware that I am not an expert or an authority on linguistics.
